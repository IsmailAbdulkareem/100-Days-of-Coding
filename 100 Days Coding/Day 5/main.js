//Question 13: Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as ‚ÄúI would like to own a Honda motorcycle.‚Äù
var transports = ["Honda motorcycle", "Tesla car", "Bianchi bicycle"];
transports.forEach(function (transport) {
    console.log("I would like to own a ".concat(transport, "."));
});
//Question 14: Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people you‚Äôd like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.
var guests = ["Albert Einstein", "Marie Curie", "Nikola Tesla"];
guests.forEach(function (guest) {
    console.log("Dear ".concat(guest, ", would you like to join me for dinner ?"));
});
//Question 15: Changing Guest List: One of your guests can't make it to the dinner, so you need to send out a new set of invitations with a replacement guest.
var unableToAttennd = "Nikola Tesla";
console.log("".concat(unableToAttennd, " can't make it to dinner."));
var newGuest = "Leonardo da Vinci";
guests[guests.indexOf(unableToAttennd)] = newGuest;
guests.forEach(function (guest) {
    console.log("Dear ".concat(guest, ", would you like to join me for dinner?"));
});
