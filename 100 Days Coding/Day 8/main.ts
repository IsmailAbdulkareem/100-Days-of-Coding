//Q22 - Intentional Error: If you havenâ€™t received an array index error in one
 //of your programs yet, try to make one happen. Change an index in one of your 
// programs to produce an index error. //Make sure you correct the error before
//  closing the program.
//var friends = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"];

//console.log(friends[1]); // Intentional error: Arrays are zero-indexed, so index 3 is out of bounds.


//Q23 - Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement
// describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your 
//code should look something like this:
let car = 'subaru';

console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")

console.log(car == 'subaru')
